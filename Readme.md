## Overview of Project
    Louise is interested in how other kickstarter projects (crowdfunding) did with respect to launch dates and funding goals when trying to fund plays.
### Purpose 
    To visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis Observations
    Anything under 5000 had the highest success rate for funding
    73% Chance of being funded in the $1K to $5K range
    Plays with a budget range from $5K to $25 has approximately 50% chance of funding
    Failure rate for crowdfunding projects above $45K is almost assured
    May and June have higher numbers of launch dates compared to other months, but their failure rate during those months is also high
    Only four months of the year in this data set were NOT above 60% for successful crowdfunding outcomes - Dec, Jan, Aug, and Oct

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The requested ranges are very broad when trying to narrow down "best chance for success" to gain funding for future projects.
        1) Establish a smaller range within the range of the overall scope.
        2) Establish a reasonable quantified target amount to expect for future crowdfunding a projects
The below chart shows that within the range of $1k to $5k, just under $2500 is the mean.  This gives the client an advantage when trying to forecast future play budgets if financed threw a crowdfunding campaigns

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1) Do not launch crowdfunding before or after Christmas, during back to school season or right before Thanksgiving
    2) May and June have the highest numbers of successful outcomes but the average thought all the months is fairly consistant with the exception listed in 1) 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The "sweet-spot" is in the $1K to $5k range, but specifically $1.6K to $3.2K range with a mean of almost $2.5K
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Nothing to compare other trends with such as environmental, economic, etc. so conclusion #1, although seems reseasonable, is unproven.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Please see the "Challenges/Difficuties Encountered" section
