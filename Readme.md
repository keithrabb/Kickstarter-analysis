### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The requested ranges are very broad when trying to narrow down "best chance for success" to gain funding for for future projects.
        1 Establish a smaller range withing the range of the overall scope.
        2 Establish a reasonable target amount to expect for future crowdfunding a project
The below chart shows that within the range of $1k to $5k, just under $2500 is the mean.  This gives the client an advantage when trying to forecast future play budgets if financed threw a crowdfunding campaign

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
