## Overview of Project
    Louise is interested in how other kickstarter projects (crowdfunding) did with respect to launch dates and funding goals when trying to fund plays.
### Purpose 
    To visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis Observations
- Anything under 5000 had the highest success rate for funding
- 73% Chance of being funded in the $1K to $5K range
- Plays with a budget range from $5K to $25 has approximately 50% chance of funding
- Failure rate for crowdfunding projects above $45K is almost assured
- May and June have higher numbers of launch dates compared to other months, but their failure rate during those months is also high
- Only four months of the year in this data set were NOT above 60% for successful crowdfunding outcomes - Dec, Jan, Aug, and Oct 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### The goal ranges are fairly broad when trying to pinpoint a target for budget, thus needing granularity to find "best chance for success".
- Establish a smaller range within a range for the data set
- Establish a reasonable quantified target amount to expect for future crowdfunding a projects

#### The below chart shows that within the range of $1K to $5K, the MEAN is just under $2500
#### Upper quartile is $3.2K and the lower quartile $1.6K

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Do not launch crowdfunding before or after Christmas, during back to school, or before Thanksgiving
    - May and June have the highest numbers of successful outcomes but the average throughout all months is fairly consistent
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - The "sweet-spot" is in the $1K to $5k range, but specifically $1.6K to $3.2K range with a mean of almost $2.5K
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - Nothing to compare other trends with such as environmental, economic, etc. so conclusion #1, although seems reseasonable, is unproven.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - Please see the "Challenges/Difficuties Encountered" section
